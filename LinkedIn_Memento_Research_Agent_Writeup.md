# LinkedIn Post: Building an AI Research Agent with Memory and Tool Integration

## 🧠 Just Built an AI Research Agent That Actually Learns and Remembers!

I'm excited to share my latest project: a **Memento-powered Research Paper Generator** that combines hierarchical AI architecture with memory-based learning to automate academic research.

### 🔥 **What Makes This Different?**

Unlike traditional AI tools that start fresh every time, this agent:

✅ **Learns from Experience** - Stores successful research patterns and retrieves relevant cases for new queries  
✅ **Thinks Hierarchically** - Meta-planner breaks down complex research into executable tasks, executor handles the detailed work  
✅ **Uses Real Tools** - Integrates with search engines, document processors, and LaTeX compilers via MCP (Model Context Protocol)  
✅ **Generates Publication-Ready Output** - Creates .md, .tex, .html, and .pdf files automatically  

### 🏗️ **The Architecture That Powers It:**

**🧠 Meta-Planner (Strategic Layer):**
- Analyzes research requirements
- Retrieves similar past research cases
- Generates JSON task plans with academic rigor
- Uses memory to inform planning decisions

**⚡ Executor (Tactical Layer):**
- Executes individual research tasks
- Orchestrates tools through MCP protocol
- Synthesizes results from multiple sources
- Records outcomes for future learning

**💾 Three-Tier Memory System:**
- **Case Memory**: High-level research patterns and strategies
- **Subtask Memory**: Active task tracking during execution
- **Tool Memory**: Logs of how tools performed for each task

### 🎯 **Real-World Impact:**

This isn't just a tech demo - it's solving actual problems:
- **Researchers** can automate literature reviews and gap analysis
- **Students** get structured, citation-rich papers in multiple formats
- **Organizations** can scale research capabilities without proportional headcount

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Highlights:**

- **OpenAI O3 Models** for advanced reasoning
- **MCP Protocol** for seamless tool integration
- **SearxNG** for privacy-respecting research
- **Tectonic LaTeX Engine** for professional PDF generation
- **Case-Based Learning** without model retraining

### 📈 **What's Next?**

Currently expanding the tool ecosystem and exploring multi-agent collaboration for complex research projects. The memory system shows promising improvements in research quality over time.

**Key Takeaway:** The future of AI isn't just about smarter models - it's about systems that learn, remember, and continuously improve their approach to complex tasks.
