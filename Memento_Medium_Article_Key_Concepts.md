**How CBR Works in Memento:**
1. **Store**: Successful problem-solution pairs are saved as cases
2. **Retrieve**: When facing a new problem, find similar past cases
3. **Adapt**: Modify past solutions to fit current context
4. **Learn**: Update case bank with new experiences

### **2. Planner-Executor Architecture**
